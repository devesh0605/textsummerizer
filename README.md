# textsummerizer
Hello this is a project built using the concepts of NLP and the gui is built using PyQt5.
For using it just create a notepad file of your text and save it in the dist folder.
Then run the .exe file and put the name in the field and press generate summary button and you will get your summary.
Thank you!!!!
